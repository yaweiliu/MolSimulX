Example systems used for PyLAT publication. For most properties, the output can be generated by running the lammps simulation and then the PyLAT.sh shell script. For the viscosity calculation, the other input files need to be generated. This is done by running the inputgenerator.py script. Then, all of the simulations need to be run. Finally, the PyLAT.sh script can be run to do the analysis.

For the Jupyter notebook examples, it is still reccommended to run in an HPC environment. Jupyter notebooks can be executed using the command "jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=-1 {$Notebook}" with the Jupyter package installed. This command will execute all code cells in the notebook.
